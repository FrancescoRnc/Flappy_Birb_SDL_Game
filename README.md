# Flappy Birb - Training Exercise

## Why this?
I wanted to exercise my C++ skills by making a clone of this famous and quite simple game.  
My goal is to make this program as similar to the original as possible, using what i learnt in the last year.  
Plus, i'll try to make it's "Engine" in order to be reusable in future.  
If someone has some tips to better the project don't be shy :)


## What i've used?
I decided to develop this game by using the SDL2 library to start,  
plus, i've cloned assets from [samuelcust](https://github.com/samuelcust)'s Repo, just for now.  
[Here](https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets)'s the link to his Repository, just to thank him :)
